1.why map reduce is rquired for pig programming
Apache Pig is a high-level platform for creating programs that run on Apache Hadoop. 
The language for this platform is called Pig Latin.so to ececute its hadoop jobs pig is map reduce is required. 
2.advantage of pig ovwer map reduce
1) developement time is decreased.
2)Learning curve is not steep.
3) it is procedural.
4)execution can be controlled.
5)even effective for large and unstructured data base.
3. What is pig engine and what is its importance?
Pig engine is a component of apache, it accepts the Pig Latin scripts as input and converts those scripts into MapReduce jobs.
importance 
Map reduce tasks can be performed easily.
easy to learn.
because of multi query approach cod elength is reduced.
4. What are the modes of Pig execution?
Local Mode
In local mode all the files are installed and run from your local host and local file system. it doesn't reqiure hadop or HDFS.
MapReduce Mode
In Map reduce mode when we execute the Pig Latin statements to process the data a MapReduce job is invoked in the back-end to perform a particular operation on the data that exists in the HDFS.
5.grunt shell in pig?
 The Grunt shell is used in  Apache Pig  to write Pig Latin scripts.
 6. What are the features of Pig Latin language?
Dynamic Invokers
Memory Management
Multi-Query Execution
in multi query execution it is first parsed to determine if intermediate tasks can be combined to reduce the overall amount of work an d also scenarios are optimized.
Explicit and Implicit Splits
7. Is Pig latin commands case sensitive?
case sensitive-1.The names (aliases) of relations and fields.2)The names of Pig Latin functions.3)Function names.
case insensitive-1.names of parameters.2)kewords.
8. What is a data flow language? 
it is a programming  that models a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations 
thus implementing dataflow principles and architecture.
it is executed in space (imaginary factory line)
